The pastor noticed that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head \"yes\" and say something. Whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, he would shake his head \"no\" and mumble a reply.   Curious, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about.

He approached them and told them that he would give them both a ride for free if neither one said a word for the whole flight.  If either one said a single word he would charge them the 50 dollars.  James and Lucille agree.The pilot takes off and climbs as fast as he can and immediately goes into a dive, but he doesn't hear a word from the couple.  He flys in circles, climbs and dives, zigs, zags, and everything in between.  The couple never say a word.  Finally he lands the helicopter.Over the head set he says \"I'm really impressed.  I did every thing I could to get a reaction from you two.\"James says \"well, I almost told you to stop when Lucille fell out, but hey, 50 doolars is 50 dollars.\"\nIs this Reddit post funny?\nThink step-by-step:\nStep 1: Look at the new Reddit post and compare it with the provided funny post patterns.\nStep 2: If the post matches the pattern, then it is likely funny.

I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.So, as the couple passes, he says to them, \"Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?\"Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,\"Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence.\"\nIs this Reddit post funny?\nThink step-by-step:\nStep 1: Look at the new Reddit post and compare it with the provided funny post patterns.\nStep 2: If the post matches the pattern, then it is likely funny.

One day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts.  \"One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me,\" said one boy. Several dropped and rolled down toward the fence.Another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. As he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. He slowed down to investigate. Sure enough, he heard, \"One for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ....\"He just knew what it was. He jumped back on his bike and rode off. Just around the bend, he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.\"Come here quick,\" said the boy, \"you won't believe what I heard! Satan and the Lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!\"The man said, \"Beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk.\" When the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.Standing by the fence they heard, \"One for you, one for me. One for you, one for me.\"The old man whispered, \"Boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. Let's see if we can see the Lord...?\" Shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. The old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the Lord.At last, they heard, \"One for you, one for me. That's all. Now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done....\"They say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.\nIs this Reddit post funny?\nThink step-by-step:\nStep 1: Look at the new Reddit post and compare it with the provided funny post patterns.\nStep 2: If the post matches the pattern, then it is likely funny.

The plumber comes over and quickly fixes the sink. The professor is happy until he gets the bill. He tells the plumber, \"How can you charge this much? This is half of my paycheck.\" But he pays it anyways.  The plumber tells him, \"Hey, we are looking for more plumbers. You could become a plumber and triple your salary. Just make sure you say you only made it to 6th grade, they don't like educated people.\"  The professor takes him up on the offer and becomes a plumber. His salary triples and he doesn't have to work nearly as hard. But the company makes an announcement that all of their plumbers must get a 7th grade education. So they all go to night school.  On the first day of night school they all attend math class. The teacher wants to gauge the class so he asks John, \"What is the formula for the area of a circle?\"  John walks up to the board and is about to write the formula when he realizes he has forgotten it. So he begins to attempt to derive the formula, filling the board with complicated mathematics. He ends up figuring out it is negative pi times radius squared. He thinks the minus doesn't belong so he starts over, but again he comes up with the same equation.

Upon their arrival, the doctor said he had invented a new machine that would transfer a portion of the mother's labor pain to the baby's father. He was asked if they were willing to try it out. They were both very much in favor of it. The doctor set the pain transfer to 10% for starters, explaining that even 10% was probably more pain than the father had ever experienced before. However, as the labor progressed, the husband felt fine and asked the doctor to go ahead and kick it up a notch. The doctor then adjusted the machine to 20% pain transfer. The husband was still feeling fine. The doctor checked the husband's blood pressure and was amazed at how well he was doing. At this point, they decided to try out for 50%. The husband continued to feel quite well. Since the pain transfer was obviously helping out the wife considerably, the husband encouraged the doctor to transfer all the pain to him. The wife delivered a healthy baby with virtually no pain. She and her husband were ecstatic.

She looked so down and out and defenseless that I took pity on her and let her into the car.I noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. She told me that she hadnt eaten for three days. So, in my compassion, I brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas I made for you last night. The ones you wouldnt eat because youre afraid youll put on weight. The poor thing devoured them in moments!Since she needed a good clean-up, I suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, I noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so I threw them away. Then, as she needed clothes, I gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but dont wear because you say they are too tight.I also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you dont wear because I dont have good taste. I found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for Christmas that you dont wear just to annoy her and I also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and dont wear because someone at work has a pair the same.The husband took a quick breath and continued, She was so grateful for my understanding and help that as I walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said Do you have anything else that your wife doesnt use?\nIs this Reddit post funny?\nThink step-by-step:\nStep 1: Look at the new Reddit post and compare it with the provided funny post patterns.\nStep 2: If the post matches the pattern, then it is likely funny.

Great! the husband says, Did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?*Moral of the story:*If you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.&nbsp;**Lesson 2:**A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie comes out. The Genie says, Ill give each of you just one wish Me first! Me first! says the administration clerk. I want to be in the Bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world. Poof! Shes gone. Me next! Me next! says the sales rep. I want to be in Hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of Pina Coladas and the love of my life. Poof! Hes gone. OK, youre up, the Genie says to the manager. The manager says, I want those two back in the office after lunch.*Moral of the story:*Always let your boss have the first say&nbsp;**Lesson 3:**A priest offered a lift to a Nun. She got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident. After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The nun said,Father, remember Psalm 129? The priest removed his hand. But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun once again said, Father, remember Psalm 129? The priest apologized Sorry sister but the flesh is weak. Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, Go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.*Moral of the story:*If you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity&nbsp;**Lesson 4**A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. A rabbit asked him, Can I also sit like you and do nothing all day long? The crow answered: Sure, why not. So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.A fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.*Moral of the story:*To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up&nbsp;**Lesson 5:**Power of CharismaA turkey was chatting with a bull I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree, sighed the turkey, but I havent got the energy. Well, why dont you nibble on my droppings? replied the bull. Theyre packed with nutrients. The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. Finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. Soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.*Moral of the story:*Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there&nbsp;**Lesson 6**A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.*Moral of the story:*1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy2. Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend3. And when youre in deep shit, its best to keep your mouth shut!&nbsp;Edit:1.

He finds him in a bar, walks in dressed in Russian attire, pretending to be Russian. Everybody in the bar looks at him, but he keeps his cool. He orders a drink and walks to the politician...\"Greetings, comrade.\" says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the Russian says, \"I think you are American spy.\"The spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, \"That is not true! I am the proudest Soviet there is! I can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!\"He then proceeds to sing the Soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.\"Very good, very good!\" says the politician. \"But I still think you are spy.\"The man continues to keep his cool. \"I am a historian! I can tell you everything about this glorious country!\". He then spends about two hours recounting the Revolution, the Great Patriotic War, about how superior to the Russia is in terms of technology compared to America and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.\"Amazing! You are skilled!\" says the politician. The spy smirks. \"But I still think you American spy.\" The spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed. He replies, \"I am good drinker, a true Russian! Let us drink, and see who can come out top!\"The bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.The bartender serves drink after drink of vodka. After about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.In the midst of the cheering, the Russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, \"You are good, you are good... but I still think you are spy.\"The American spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.\"Okay, you got me. I am an American. But what made you think that way, after all this time?\"The Russian politician replies, \"There aren't many black people in Russia.\"\nIs this Reddit post funny?\nThink step-by-step:\nStep 1: Look at the new Reddit post and compare it with the provided funny post patterns.\nStep 2: If the post matches the pattern, then it is likely funny.

Pretty great to always have a brand new car.Problem is I sort of hit a brick wall and didnt know what else to wish for. I thought for a bit and told the genie well Im not sure what else to wish for, but you are pretty hot. Want to fool around?The genie responded hey its your wish.
