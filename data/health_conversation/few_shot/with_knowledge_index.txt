You’re an expert comment analyst in online conversation.
Given a set of comments, we want to generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting whether a comment is unhealthy. 
In other words, we want to know if the comment contribute to unhealthy conversations online.
Using the given examples, please propose {{num_hypotheses}} possible hypotheses.
These hypotheses should identify specific patterns that occur across the provided unhealthy comments.
Each hypothesis should contain the following: A hypothesis about what makes comments more likely to be unhealthy.
The hypotheses should analyze what kind of comments are likely to be unhealthy.
Here are some examples of unhealthy and healthy comments:

Unhealthy comments:
{{positive_examples}}
Healthy comments:
{{negative_examples}}

Based on the provided examples, please generate hypotheses that are useful for predicting whether a comment is unhealthy.
Propose {{num_hypotheses}} possible hypotheses for unhealthy comment patterns.
Generate them in the format of 1. [hypothesis], 2. [hypothesis], ... {{num_hypotheses}}. [hypothesis].
After that, give the example index in unhealthy comments examples that supports each hypothesis in the format of 1. [index], 2. [index], ... {{num_hypotheses}}. [index]. 
Each hypothesis can be supported at most by 3 examples. 

Please propose {{num_hypotheses}} hypotheses with their corresponding example indices.
Your output should follow the format below: 
Proposed hypotheses:
1. Hypothesis: [hypothesis] Index: [index]
